# Hello-World
This is exercise 0 for CS50
My name is Erhart Schroeder.  I am 65 years old with a history of programming that ended 18 years ago  I am taking this course to learn new skills.  I have had Parkinsons disease for the last 9 years and was bad enough that quit work 5 years ago.  Last year I went through a deep brain stimulation which helped signifantly.
